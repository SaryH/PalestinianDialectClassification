# PalestinianDialectClassification
 Project for my Spoken Language Processing course at Birzeit University. The project consists of building a classifier for 4 different dialects of the Palestinian Speech.

 The proposed model achieved 73% accuracy on the test data, which is impressive given the small size of the dataset used in training.
